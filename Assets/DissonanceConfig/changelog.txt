 - Added a VoicePlayerState object for the local player, provides events and live amplitude measurement for the local player

Bugfixes:
 - Fixed null reference exception being thrown if the VoiceBroadcastTrigger was misconfigured

# 1.0.8

Features:
 - Completely new VAD! Based on the excellent voice detector created for the Chromium WebRTC project.
 - Improved network inspector to show live traffic rates for different kinds of Dissonance traffic (10 second moving average)

   - OnPlayerJoinedSession
   - OnPlayerLeftSession
   - OnPlayerStartedSpeaking
   - OnPlayerStoppedSpeaking
 - Updated all custom editors to properly push onto the undo/redo stack when Dissonance components are modified
   - This also marks the scene as dirty (i.e. save required)

Bugfixes:
 - Fixed the default spatial blend on a playback prefab being zero (now it's 1.0)
 - Fixed positional audio playback when a spatializer is not in use (use the SpatializedPlaybackPrefab in Plugins/Dissonance/Resources if you are using a spatializer)
   - Check the `VoicePlayback` inspector when the game is running to check what spatialization mode is in use

Known Issues:
 - Lacking platform support for  Windows Universal Platform
 - VAD does not always work well (particularly on mobile devices)
  - We have an entirely new VAD in development

 - Fixed LLAPI integration not properly handling the disconnect event (leaving the session in an inconsistent state and preventing future reconnections).
 - Fixed microphone capture losing some data in extremely low framerate situations.

Internals:
